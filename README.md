## 📌 Project Overview

Legal documents are often lengthy and complex. This project simplifies legal document review by:
- Automatically summarizing long legal PDFs
- Extracting key entities using Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Supporting both text-based and scanned PDF documents (OCR seen in extended version)

This system is useful for legal researchers, students, and professionals who want quick insights from legal documents.
